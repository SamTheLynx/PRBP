# PRBP

You will have to open up 2 split terminals. One for the frontend and one for the backend.

Terminal 1: 'cd api'
            'npm install'
            'nodemon index.js'

Terminal 2: 'cd client'
            'npm install'
            'npm start'

Terminal 2: 'cd api'
            'npm install'
            'node index.js'

Features need to be implemented: 
1. Forms Acceptance 
2. Forms rejection
Issues Need to be revised:
1. in API middleware have been implemented and itrs working on postman but not working when we connect the api with frontend.
2. API's are also written with middleware in controller folder 
3. As middleware was not working thats why simple APIs are also written that can be replaced if the issue gets resolved.
